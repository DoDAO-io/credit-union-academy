## Navigating Uncertain Times


## The Predicted Recession of 2023

The predicted recession in America for 2023 has been a topic of debate among economists. While Goldman Sachs Research estimates a 65% probability of a downturn, other economists, like David Mericle, have a more optimistic view with a 35% probability. Mericle believes that a recession is not necessary to tame inflation and that below-potential growth can gradually rebalance supply and demand in the labor market. Additionally, the impact of last year's financial conditions tightening by the Federal Reserve is expected to diminish this year. Mericle also predicts a steady narrowing of the jobs-workers gap, which will contribute to a more sustainable rate of wage growth.

Another factor to consider is the supply chain recovery and the deflationary impulse in the goods sector, which has taken longer than expected but has finally arrived. This is expected to push core goods inflation negative next year and drive the decline in overall core inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to deliver three rate hikes in the first half of 2023 and then hold the funds rate for the rest of the year. However, there is skepticism about whether the FOMC will cut rates just because inflation comes down. The more likely rationale for cutting rates would be if the economy enters a recession or threatens to do so without an easing in monetary policy.

There are also factors outside of monetary policy that could impact the economy. Congress could pass fiscal policy changes in response to a recession, but the divided control of Congress makes it harder to respond to a downturn. The debt limit deadline is another political risk that could disrupt financial markets and the economy. While spending cuts could occur, the odds lean against substantial changes.

Despite the predictions of a recession, there are reasons to be optimistic about the economy. The U.S. economy has been remarkably resilient and has defied forecasts of a downturn. Factors such as excess savings, a strong labor market, low levels of debt, and falling oil prices contribute to the optimism. However, economists still expect a recession in the second half of 2023, as the impact of high interest rates and reduced lending by banks may be felt more profoundly by consumers and businesses. The inverted yield curve, where the yield on the 2-year Treasury bond is higher than the 10-year Treasury, is also seen as a reliable indicator of a coming recession.

## What is BNPL?

Buy now, pay later (BNPL) is a growing trend among retailers, offering consumers the option to make purchases and pay for them in installments. These offers are often extended by third-party companies, allowing consumers to finance their purchases without accruing revolving interest charges. BNPL can be advantageous for both sellers and buyers, as it makes purchases more appealing and can result in increased sales. It is also easier to qualify for BNPL compared to traditional credit cards, making it a popular choice for those with limited credit history. Online shoppers, in particular, find the immediate gratification of BNPL offers to be a convenient and preferable way to shop.

While BNPL offers can be beneficial, it's important to understand the terms and potential risks involved. Some offers may have a 0% interest rate for a limited time, but if payments are not made on time or in full, high penalties and deferred interest charges may apply. It's crucial to carefully review the terms of the deal before committing to a BNPL loan. Additionally, using BNPL can lead to overspending, as the ability to pay off purchases over time may encourage shoppers to make impulsive decisions and spend more than they can afford. Late payments can also result in late fees and potentially damage your credit score.

Despite the potential risks, BNPL can be a useful tool for spreading out payments on necessary purchases. It provides flexibility in qualifying criteria and offers instant approvals, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers. However, it's important to use BNPL responsibly and avoid overextending yourself with multiple plans. It's also worth considering other borrowing options, such as credit cards, which may offer rewards and perks if used responsibly. Ultimately, the decision to use BNPL should be based on your individual financial situation and needs.

## Gig economy and Personal Finance

In the gig economy, managing personal finances can be challenging but crucial for financial stability. As a guide for Gen Z, here are some tips on how to navigate personal finances in gig economy setups.

Firstly, it is important to track your income and expenses diligently. Since gig workers often have irregular income, it is essential to create a budget and stick to it. This will help you understand your financial situation and make informed decisions about your spending and saving habits.

Secondly, it is crucial to plan for taxes as a gig worker. Unlike traditional employees, gig workers are responsible for their own taxes. Set aside a portion of your income for taxes and consider consulting with a tax professional to ensure you are meeting your obligations.

Additionally, it is important to prioritize saving for emergencies and retirement. As a gig worker, you may not have access to employee benefits like retirement plans or health insurance. Therefore, it is essential to establish your own safety net by saving for emergencies and considering options like individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for long-term savings.

Lastly, consider diversifying your income streams. Gig work can be unpredictable, so having multiple sources of income can provide stability and reduce financial stress. Explore different gig opportunities or consider developing additional skills that can open up new income streams.

By following these tips, Gen Z gig workers can better manage their personal finances and navigate the uncertainties of the gig economy. Remember to stay informed, plan ahead, and make wise financial decisions to achieve financial stability and success.
