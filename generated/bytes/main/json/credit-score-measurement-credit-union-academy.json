Companies use credit scores to make decisions on whether to offer you a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, and other credit products, as well as for tenant screening and insurance. They are also used to determine the interest rate and credit limit you receive. Companies use a mathematical formula—called a scoring model—to create your credit score from the information in your credit report.",
