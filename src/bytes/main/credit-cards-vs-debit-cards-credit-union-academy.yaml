      Credit cards and debit cards may seem similar, but they have important
      differences. Credit cards allow you to borrow money and pay it back later,
      while debit cards deduct money directly from your bank account.

      When using a debit card, the funds used for a purchase come directly from
      your bank account. With a credit card, you borrow money from the card
      issuer and repay it later, often with interest and fees.

      Credit cards offer the option to pay off the balance in full or make
      minimum payments. If you only make the minimum payment, interest charges
      can quickly accumulate and make it harder to pay off the debt.

      Debit cards do not build credit since they do not report card activity to
      credit bureaus. Credit cards, on the other hand, can help you build credit
      when used responsibly.

      Credit cards provide more robust fraud protection compared to debit cards.
      With credit cards, your liability for unauthorized charges is often
      limited to $50, while debit cards may hold you fully liable if not
      reported promptly.

      Debit cards are linked to your checking account and allow you to spend
      only what you have. Credit cards provide a line of credit, allowing you to
      spend beyond your current funds, but this can lead to debt if not managed
      responsibly.

      Credit cards often come with rewards programs, offering cash back, travel
      points, or other benefits. Debit cards generally do not offer the same
      level of rewards.
