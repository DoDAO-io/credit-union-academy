      Getting through college debt-free is always a better choice. According to
      the Federal Reserve, the student loan debt average had risen to $1.7
      trillion. Taking on student debt means spending your entire young
      adulthood, and much of your middle-age years, repaying those loans. Here
      are some tips to help you achieve a debt-free college education.

      Consider attending a community college or a no-loan school to reduce
      costs. Attending a community college can give students time to work, save
      money, and earn credits before transferring to a four-year college. Some
      colleges offer free tuition or have policies of meeting the full financial
      need of students without relying on student loans.

      Estimate college costs and factor in expenses beyond tuition. Use net
      price calculators and financial aid information to determine the actual
      amount you will need to pay. Maximize other funding sources such as
      grants, scholarships, and college savings plans before resorting to
      student loans.

      Start a side hustle or get a part-time job to offset costs and minimize
      borrowing. Consider platforms like YouTube and TikTok for earning income
      or look for companies that offer tuition assistance. Limit living expenses
      and be frugal whenever possible to avoid unnecessary debt.

      Borrow only the amount needed and carefully consider the long-term
      consequences of student loans. Understand the repayment terms and use
      resources like the National Student Loan Data System to stay on top of
      your loans. Know your salary expectations and aim to owe less than your
      potential starting salary.

      Evaluate student loan options and prioritize federal loans before
      considering private loans. Private loans often have higher interest rates
      and less favorable repayment terms. Explore college financing options and
      research scholarships, grants, and work-study programs to reduce the need
      for loans.
