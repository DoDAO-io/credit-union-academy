      A credit score is a prediction of your credit behavior, such as how likely
      you are to pay a loan back on time, based on information from your credit
      reports. Companies use credit scores to make decisions on whether to offer
      you a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, and other credit products, as well
      as for tenant screening and insurance. They are also used to determine the
      interest rate and credit limit you receive.

      Credit scores are created using a mathematical formula called a scoring
      model, which takes into account factors such as your bill-paying history,
      current unpaid debt, the number and type of loan accounts you have, how
      long you have had your loan accounts open, how much of your available
      credit you're using, new applications for credit, and any past debt sent
      to collection, foreclosure, or bankruptcy.

      Each credit score depends on the data used to calculate it, the scoring
      model, the source of the data, and the date it was calculated. Generally,
      a higher credit score makes it easier to qualify for a loan and may result
      in better interest rates or loan terms. Most credit scores range from
      300-850.

      Credit scoring is used by lenders and financial institutions to determine
      the creditworthiness of individuals and small businesses. The most widely
      used credit scoring system is the FICO score, created by Fair Isaac
      Corporation. Another popular scoring model is VantageScore, created by the
      top three credit-reporting agencies. Credit scores are an important factor
      in risk-based pricing, where the terms of a loan are based on the
      probability of repayment.

      Credit scores have limitations, as they cannot explicitly factor in
      current economic conditions or determine the exact default probability of
      borrowers. However, advancements in technology and credit risk modeling
      continue to refine the accuracy of credit scores. It is important for
      individuals to understand how credit scoring works and to take steps to
      improve their credit scores, such as making payments on time, decreasing
      debt, and maintaining a healthy mix of credit.
